# Birds-detection-tool-which-is-based-on-YOLOv10
Here is a birds detection tool which is based on YOLOv10. This idea of tool refer to [Optimized SmallWaterbird Detection Method Using
Surveillance Videos Based on YOLOv7](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/12/1929#:~:text=This%20study%20describes%20an%20improved,attention%20regions%20and%20monitor%20waterbirds.).

In this time, I don't only present this tool, but also compare the performances of different models which are produced by different pretrained file of YOLOv10.

## How to begin
for yolov10, you could follow this [yolov10](https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10/tree/main).
